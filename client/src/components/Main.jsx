          That is what coffee is. An exquisite mahogany hued jewel created to
          infuse our taste buds and senses to heavenly rapture. The aroma alone
          titialtes the senses. When grounded and mixed with water, it becomes a
          divine sable brew. Whether imbibed au naturel or complemented with
          various sweeteners, dairy or non dairy enhancers, hot or ice cold, it
          is unrivaled in taste.
          <br />
          <br />
          If the exquisite taste alone is not enough to partake in the libation,
          the health bonuses should. It has been proved that coffee has
          nutritive benefits for the heart, liver, brain, mental health, insulin
          production, weight management. longevity and/or athletic performance.
          It is truly more fitting to say, "a cup a day keeps the doctor away".
