# What is Brewmance?

- Brewmance is a mixture of node, template, and html to create a recipe web application with coffee as the star ingredient. Whether you love coffee or want to begin a new journey, the API call from Spoonacular will dynamically display recipes to cycle through. Information about coffee can be found with a Google Map API as well.

# Why Brewmance?

- My mom loves coffee. I do not. But I do bake and the recipes found within have a lot of creative and tasty dishes that are easy to make.

- I also wanted to take on the task of writing code outside of a framework like React. Practicing my template and back-end skills.

## This is how I get started with apps and web pages.
